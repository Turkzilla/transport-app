# Fleet Management System
## A mock fleet management software using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node)

#### Description
Built using React, the app allows a dispatcher to assign jobs to open drivers and see in real time the status of a job. A job can be unassigned, active, or completed. A driver cannot be assigned two jobs at once, allowing for easy fleet management.

#### Features
* A birds eye of view of all current jobs, organized by unassigned, active, or completed status.
* Ability to assign a job only to those drivers who are not already completing an assignment, giving the dispatcher insight into who is on the road and who is not
* Mark a job as completed once the driver has indicated they have completed the assignment
